This is my first time build website using Jekyll. Honestly, i was kinda annoying about why my posts doesnt show up in the
post list. It says that, to generate a post you have to create a markdown file inside `_posts` directory and naming it with
`YYYY-MM-DD-title` and then you can modify default behavior by create `front matter` inside a newly created post. I dont know what I have done wrong, the fact that my post doesnt show up really bothering me huhu ðŸ˜Ÿ. After a long debugging I resolve the issue, `it cannot future date` mwuehehe ðŸ˜‚. What's going on in my mind to put a future date there lol. finally it shows all posts, thanks to `copilot` and `chat gpt` ðŸš€.
